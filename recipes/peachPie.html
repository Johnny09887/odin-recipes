  <h1 class="mainTitle">Chef John's Peach Pie</h1>
  <img src="../images/peachPie.webp" alt="Peach Pie" class="images" height="300">
  <h2 class="secondTitles">Description</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">This peach pie is above and beyond beautiful. The lattice design is also very practical.<br> When
    making pie with
    something
    like peaches, the relatively open top allows lots of moisture to evaporate,<br> which helps prevent the dreaded
    watery
    pie
    syndrome. That's also why we boil the excess juices into syrup.</p>
  <h2 class="secondTitles">Ingredients</h2>
  <ul class="list01">
    <li>3 pounds fresh freestone peaches, peeled and sliced</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar, divided</li>
    <li>1 tiny pinch salt</li>
    <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne peppe</li>
    <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 14.1 ounce package double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons butter, cut into tiny pieces</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar, or to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="secondTitles">Steps</h2>
  <ul class="list02">
    <li>Step 1</li>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
    <li>Step 2</li>
    <p>Stir together peaches, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt in a large bowl until combined; let sit for 20 to 30 minutes.<br>
      Strain
      accumulated juices into a saucepan and return strained peaches to the bowl.</p>
    <li>Step 3</li>
    <p>Bring juices in the saucepan to a boil; reduce heat to medium-high and cook until mixture thickens to a syrup, 5
      to 10
      minutes.</p>
    <li>Step 4</li>
    <p>Whisk together 1/2 cup sugar, flour, and cornstarch in a medium bowl.<br> Stir lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and
      cinnamon
      into peaches; sprinkle with flour mixture and toss to coat.<br> Pour hot peach syrup over peach mixture and stir.
    </p>
    <li>Step 5</li>
    <p>Roll out one pastry into a 12-inch circle. Press into the bottom of a 10-inch pie plate.<br> Pour peach filling
      into
      crust,
      tap the pie plate against a flat surface to settle filling, and dot with butter.</p>
    <li>Step 6</li>
    <p>Roll remaining pastry into an 11-inch circle and cut into 1-inch strips using<br> a paring knife or pastry wheel.
    </p>
    <li>Step 7</li>
    <p>Lay 5 pastry dough strips evenly over the top of pie. Weave remaining pastry dough strips through to form a
      lattice top.<br>
      Fold the ends of lattice strips under bottom crust and crimp crust to seal. Brush cream over the top and sprinkle
      with 1
      tablespoon sugar.</p>
    <li>Step 8</li>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is browned and filling is bubbly, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool completely
      before
      slicing.
    </p>
  </ul>
